Privacy Policy for LockLoom
Last updated: 23OCT2025

Overview
LockLoom uses the device camera and microphone if and after you configure it.

Data Collection & Use
• Images/Video/Audio: processed on-device and trasnsmitted only per your configuration and only if you setup recipients.
• Storage: We do not store or receive camera images/videos/audio on our servers. No data exfil back to us.
• Sharing: We do not sell or share data with third parties. No ads either.
• Security: The mobile telemetry agent only ships alerts and evidence after wrapping the payload in end-to-end encryption, so the message that heads toward your designated contacts is already sealed before it ever leaves the device.

User Choices & Controls
• You can access in device settings.

Children’s Privacy (if applicable)
Our app is not directed to children under 13/16.

Changes
We may update this policy. We’ll post updates on this page with a new “Last updated” date.
